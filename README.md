# 01-Code-Refactor

This project is an exercise in cleaning, organizing, improving, and deploying existing webpage code using both HTML and CSS.

The project uses existing webpage code for a fictitious digital marketing company, Horiseon, notes their areas of expertise: search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.
The original HTML and CSS code is written with an overall lack of semantic structure and often repeats code unnecessarily. The refactoring of the code has resulted in a more streamlined approach making it more readable, functionable, accessible.
